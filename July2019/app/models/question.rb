class Question < ApplicationRecord

  # This is the Question model. We generated this file
  # with the command:
  # rails generate model question title:string body:text
  # Or in general:
  # rails generate model ModelName ColumnOneName:ColumnOneType ColumnTwoName:ColumnTwoType


  # This command also generates a migration file in
  # db/migrate

  # Rail will add attr_accessors for all columns of the table (i.e. id, title, body, created_at, updated_at)

  # Create validations by using the `validates` method.
  # The arguments are (in order):
  # - A column name as a symbol
  # - Named arguments corresponding to validation rules

  # To read more on validations, go to the following guide:
  # https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html

      # Be careful, the method for custom validations is
      # singular and its almost exactly same the method
      # for regular validations.

      # `before_validation` is a lifecycle callback method that allows us
      # to respond to events during the life a model instance (e.g. being validated,
      # being created, being updated, etc)
      # All lifecycle callback methods take a symbol named after a method
      # and calls that method at the appropriate time.
