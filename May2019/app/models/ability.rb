  # Cancancan assumes you have a method called
  # `current_user` available in your ApplicationController
  # (which we do). Cancancan gets automatically
  # initialized with  `current_user` passed to the
  # initialize method.
  def initialize(user)
    # Define abilities for the passed in user here. For example:
    #
      user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)
    #   if user.admin?
    #     can :manage, :all
    #   else
    #     can :read, :all
    #   end
    if user.is_admin?
      can :manage, :all
    end
    # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
    # permission to do.
    # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
    # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
    #
    # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
    # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
    # class of the resource.
    #
    # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
    # objects.
    # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
    #
    #   can :update, Article, :published => true

    # Use the `alias_action` method to assign
    # multiple names to one action alias. This
    # means the alias can be used in place for any of
    # the supplied actions.
    # In this case, :crud can be used wherever :create,
    # :read, :update or :destroy would be used.
    alias_action :create, :read, :update, :destroy, to: :crud
    # To define a permission for a User, use the `can`
    # method inside of this class' initialize method.
    # It takes the following args in order:
    # - The name of the action you are testing permission
    # for, as a symbol.
    # - The class of an object we are testing the action
    # against (i.e. Question, Answer, User, etc.)
    # - A block that is used to determine whether or not
    # a user can perform said action on the resource/
    # class.
     # If the block returns true, the user can perform
     # the action, otherwise they can't.\
    can(:crud, Question) do |question|
      question.user == user
    end
    # We can also write abilities like:
    # can :crud, Question, user_id: user.id
    can(:crud, Answer) do |answer|
      answer.user == user
      # If we wanted to allow both the answer owner and
      # the question owner to have the ability to ':crud'
      # Answers:
      # answer.user == user || answer.question.user == user
    end

  end
